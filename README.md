# Hacker-News
This project is based on the hacker news platform which is a platform used for sharing news about the tech industry generally.
It's objective is to reduce the time spent by the consumer of the news to peruse through the entire page by obtaining only the most relevent news that might be of interest to the consumer. Therefore this not only saves time but also saves on the internet costs that could have been potentially spent.
